<h2 align="left"> Introduction </h2>
<p align="left"> Mechanical engineering senior project to build an autonoumous tour-guide robot that navigates an office building environment. Robot is tasked with providing tours to groups of people highlighting the various attractions of the building. </p>


<h2 align="left"> Deployment </h2>
<p align="left"> The base of the robot consists of a modified Traxxas Slash 4x4 utilizing a stock brushed motor and a nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) battery in order to reduce speed and better control the robot. The robot was built utilizing the
  
  [Donkeycar](https://github.com/wroscoe/donkey) platform, consisting of a Raspberry Pi, PiCam, PCA 9685 servo driver, as well as a RPLidar A2 360 laser scanner.</p>

<h2 align="left"> Dataset and Analysis </h2>
<p align="left"> In order to prevent the neural network from learning ever-changing objects in the course environment, e.g. moved furniture, the robot's camera was oriented at approximately 53Â° from the horizontal towards the ceiling.  In doing so, the network learned the course's ceiling lights and tiles, which enabled the robot to consistently navigate the course environment without being affected by ambient light or temporarily moved objects.
</p>

<p align="left"> In attempting to find the best possible model, several different neural network architectures (e.g. linear and categorical convnets, as well as an RNN Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)) were analyzed.  Figure 1 below demonstrates how the models performed with respect to the accuracy metric on the test set.

<h5 align="center"> Figure 1: Comparison of Model Test Accuracy </h5>
  
<p align="left"> Figure 1 clearly demonstrates that the LSTM model achieves an amazingly high level of accuracy. Compared with the other models the LSTM outperforms the Categorical and Linear Convnets by approximately 18% and 75% respectively.
